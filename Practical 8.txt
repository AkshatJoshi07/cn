Implementation of SUBNETTING
Subnetting is the process of dividing a single IP network into multiple smaller, logical networks called subnets. This is done by borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address and using them as network bits

Steps to Implement Subnetting in Cisco Packet Tracer
1. Plan the Network
Choose an IP Address Range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

Define subnet masks based on required hosts per subnet.

2. Configure IP Addresses on PCs
Assign subnetted IP addresses manually to each PC:
PC1: 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.192  
PC2: 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.192  
PC3: 192.168.1.65 255.255.255.192  
3. Configure IP Addresses on Routers
 1 Enter CLI Mode
enable  
configure terminal  
 2 Assign IPs to Router Interfaces
 
interface FastEthernet 0/0  
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.192  
no shutdown  
exit  

interface FastEthernet 0/1  
ip address 192.168.1.65 255.255.255.192  
no shutdown  
exit  
4. Configure Routing (If Needed)
For communication between subnets, use Static or Dynamic Routing:
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.192 192.168.1.1  
ip route 192.168.1.64 255.255.255.192 192.168.1.65  
5. Test Connectivity
Use ping to check if devices in the same subnet communicate.

Ping across subnets (if routing is configured).
