1) NETWORK DEVICE:-
Hub – A basic device that broadcasts data to all connected devices without filtering.

Switch – A network device that forwards data only to the intended recipient using MAC addresses.

Router – Connects multiple networks and directs data packets based on IP addresses.

Bridge – Connects two or more network segments to function as a single network.

Modem – Converts digital data into analog signals (and vice versa) for internet access.

Gateway – Acts as a protocol converter between different network architectures.

Access Point (AP) – Provides wireless connectivity to extend a wired network.

Firewall – A security device that monitors and filters network traffic to prevent threats.

2) TCP/IP in Computer Networks
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols used for transmitting data over the internet and other networks. It defines how data is sent, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.
Layers of TCP/IP Model:
Application Layer – Provides network services to applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).

Transport Layer – Ensures reliable data delivery using TCP (connection-oriented) or UDP (connectionless).

Internet Layer – Handles packet routing using IP addresses (e.g., IPv4, IPv6).

Network Access Layer – Manages physical data transmission over network hardware (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

3) Important Protocols
HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) – Used for web communication; HTTPS is the secure version.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – Used for transferring files between computers over a network.
DNS (Domain Name System) – Translates domain names to IP addresses.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – Ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data packets.
IP (Internet Protocol) – Handles addressing and routing of packets across networks.

4) OSI Model: 7 Layers with Definitions
Physical Layer – Transmits raw data bits over physical mediums like cables and wireless signals.

Data Link Layer – Ensures reliable data transfer between directly connected devices using MAC addresses.

Network Layer – Handles routing and addressing of data packets using IP addresses.

Transport Layer – Ensures end-to-end communication, reliability, and flow control (TCP/UDP).

Session Layer – Manages and controls communication sessions between applications.

Presentation Layer – Translates, encrypts, and compresses data for the application layer.

Application Layer – Provides network services directly to end-user applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).
