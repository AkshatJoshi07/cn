set up a simple network with pcs ,switches and hub and configure ip address and test connectivity using the ping command. and give the steps in a shortest way in cisco packet

PC (Personal Computer): A device used to send and receive data in a network.

Switch: A network device that connects multiple devices and forwards data only to the intended recipient using MAC addresses.

Hub: A network device that broadcasts data to all connected devices, making it less efficient than a switch.

IP Address: A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device in a network for communication (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

Ping Command: A network utility used to test connectivity between devices by sending packets and receiving responses.

Step 1: Add Devices
Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

Drag and drop:

3 PCs (PC0, PC1, PC2)

1 Switch

1 Hub

Use Copper Straight-Through Cables to connect:

PC0, PC1 → Switch

Switch → Hub

Hub → PC2

Step 2: Assign IP Addresses
Click on PC0 → Go to Desktop → Click IP Configuration

Set IP: 192.168.1.1

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Repeat for other PCs:

PC1 → 192.168.1.2

PC2 → 192.168.1.3

Step 3: Test Connectivity
Open Command Prompt on PC0 (Desktop → Command Prompt).

Type:
ping 192.168.1.2
(To check connection between PC0 and PC1)

Type:
ping 192.168.1.3
(To check connection between PC0 and PC2 via the hub)

Step 4: Verify Connectivity
If replies are received, the network is working! ✅

If no reply, check cables and IP configuration.
