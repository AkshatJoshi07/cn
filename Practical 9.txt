Routing at Network Layer
Routing at Network Layer (Cisco Packet Tracer Steps)
Routing is the process of forwarding data packets between different networks using routers. It occurs at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI Model.

Steps to Implement Routing in Cisco Packet Tracer
1. Set Up Network Devices
Add two or more PCs, two or more routers, and switches.

Connect PCs to switches (use straight-through cables).

Connect routers to switches (use straight-through or cross-over cables).

2. Assign IP Addresses
Assign IP addresses to PCs (e.g., 192.168.1.2/24 and 192.168.2.2/24).

Configure router interfaces with IPs in the correct subnets.

3. Configure Router Interfaces
Enter CLI mode:
enable  
configure terminal  
Assign IPs to router interfaces:
interface FastEthernet 0/0  
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0  
no shutdown  
exit  

interface FastEthernet 0/1  
ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0  
no shutdown  
exit  
4. Configure Routing (Static or Dynamic)
➡ Static Routing (Manually specify paths):
ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1  
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1  
➡ Dynamic Routing (Use routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP):
For RIP:
router rip  
version 2  
network 192.168.1.0  
network 192.168.2.0  
no auto-summary  
exit  
5. Test Connectivity
Use the ping command between PCs in different networks.

Use tracert to check the routing path.
